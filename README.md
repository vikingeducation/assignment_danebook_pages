#  Bootstraped Replica of Facebook Pages

Created using HTML5, CSS3, SASS and Bootstrap. I created these pages based only on visual appearance of the following Facebook pages:
- About Page
- About Edit Page
- Friends
- Photos
- Timeline
- Upgraded Homepage (originally created in the assignment_danebook_homepage)
